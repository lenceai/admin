## Interactive Documentation Access

**Built-in Cluster Documentation:**
- There are two types of documentation provided on the Cluster. One is interactive page which provides live interaction to the Cluster for developers who want to gain hands-on experience on the REST APIs before start developing
- Access via cluster UI: Help menu → REST API
- Interactive testing interface for real-time API exploration

## Authentication

**Access Token Method:**
- Before making any API requests, the first step is always to make a "POST /public/accessTokens" request with valid Cohesity credentials
- Token-based authentication required for most operations
- API keys available for service accounts

- The API documentation can be found in the [Cohesity Developers Portal](https://developers.cohesity.com/reference)

## Important Notes

- This API documentation is unmaintained, please look at specific cluster's RestAPI docs page - Always check your specific cluster's documentation
- Each cluster version may have different API capabilities
- The interactive documentation on each cluster provides the most accurate reference for that specific version

For the most current and version-specific API reference, I recommend accessing the interactive documentation directly from your Cohesity cluster's web interface, as this will show the exact APIs available for your specific cluster version.
